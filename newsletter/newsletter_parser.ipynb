    "    main_text='<p>SARS-CoV-2 gains entry to human cells through its spike (S) protein binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Therefore, the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein is the primary target for neutralizing antibodies. Selection of broad-neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are attractive and might be useful for treating not only COVID-19, but also future SARS-related CoV infections. Broad-neutralizing antibodies, such as 47D11, S309, and VHH-72, have been reported to target a conserved region in the RBD of the S1 subunit. The S2 subunit required for viral membrane fusion might be another target. Due to their small size and high stability, single-domain antibodies might have the ability to be administered by an inhaler making them potentially attractive therapeutics for respiratory infections. A cocktail strategy combining two (or more) antibodies that recognize different parts of the viral surface that interact with human cells might be the most effective (see the Figure 1)</p> <p>You are welcome to read the full length of this article (currently uncorrected manuscript free of charge by clicking on link above.
